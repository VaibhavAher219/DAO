## How It Works

1. **Ownership Requirement**: In order to participate in CryptoDevs DAO, you need to own a CryptoDevs NFT. This NFT serves as your membership and voting right within the DAO.

2. **Proposal Creation**: Any CryptoDevs NFT owner can create a proposal to purchase a specific NFT from an NFT marketplace. Proposals should include details about the target NFT, such as its name, description, and marketplace link.

3. **Voting**: All CryptoDevs NFT owners can vote for or against active proposals. Each NFT counts as one vote for each proposal. Voters cannot vote multiple times on the same proposal using the same NFT.

4. **Deadline**: Each proposal has a specified deadline for voting. Once the deadline is reached, voting is closed, and the proposal moves to the decision-making phase.

5. **Decision Making**: If the majority of voters vote in favor of a proposal by the deadline, the purchase of the target NFT is automatically executed from the marketplace.
